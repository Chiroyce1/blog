###### FYI - My real name isn't Chiroyce <br><br><br>

## TL;DR

I'm a 14 year old boy from India who likes technology, programming, photography and cars.

## When the pandemic began...

So at this point I had a good interest in cars and a beginner-level interest in photography/videography. I didn't exactly know much about tech, but I was used to using iOS, Android, Windows 7, and the Google Chrome browser.

I started learning about programming 3 years ago, when I first used [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). For some reason, I used the [offline editor (for Scratch 2.0)](https://scratch.mit.edu/download/scratch2) and never made an account until the pandemic began (exactly in March 2020).

I did also learn the ***very basics*** of Python, printing, mathematical operations and strings.

Since India was in lockdown due to the pandemic, I was bored, sitting at home. My family sometimes used to play a boardgame, where you win by getting 3 of your "tokens" in a row. So  My dad asked me if I wanted to try to remake the boardgame in Scratch. So I used the [3.0 editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/) for the first time (without an account) to try to remake the game. I was somewhat succesful, so then I thought I could share it with the Scratch community, so I made an account.

## Why did you choose "Chiroyce"?
So it's a combination of two cars that I like. It's the [Bugatti Chiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron) and the [Rolls Royce Cullinan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Cullinan). If you try to merge `Chiron` and `Royce` you sort of get `Chiroyce`, which to me, sounded cool. I have to say, I'm very glad I chose that, because even after around 2 years later, I still like the username!

## What about the project you shared?
Well it's still on the website!! [Here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/388790486/) is a link to it. It's got a really long description! I remember that I used to check the view count every day, and around two days after releasing the project, it got around 6 views, I was super excited! So yeah.. I then contined to make projects on Scratch! A full list of my **shared** projects can be found [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Chiroyce/projects/).

## Bye 2020...

So yeah 2020 went by quick, I had online school and shared exactly `26` projects that year. By the end of the year, I had around `1000` followers on Scratch, which was (and still is), crazy. I did get better at Python (arrays, dictionaries, functions) and also played around with code that interacted with the [Scratch API](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-rest-api/wiki) (thanks [@CubeyTheCube](https://github.com/CubeyTheCube) for [scratchclient](https://github.com/CubeyTheCube/scratchclient)!).

## Hello, 2021!

New year, so uhh.. same pandemic, sadly. Online school went on, me making projects on Scratch went on... I significantly got better at programming outside and in Scratch. I made a few projects like [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/448185902/), [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/424893697/) and [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/453335044/), which all got over 20,000 views ðŸ¤¯ - and around 2000 likes on average. Outside of Scratch, I mainly used:

- `Python` 
- `JavaScript` 
- `CSS` 
- `HTML`
- `SQLite`
